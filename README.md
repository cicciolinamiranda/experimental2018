# experimental

- Percent support: do they work in lists?
- Notifications: multi-line notifications show `@17041057` (the `R` id?) instead of `...` (This seems to be fixed in M)
- LinearLayout optimisations
- Resource annotations
- ViewStubs and RecyclerView: do they work together?
- AlertDialog with a data binding-enabled custom view
